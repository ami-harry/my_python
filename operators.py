# operators in python
# arithmetic operator
# assignment operator
# logical operator
# bitwise operator
# identity operator
# membership operator
# comparision operator

# arithmetic operator
# [+, -, *, /,//,**,%]
# print("10+5= ", 10+5)
# print("10-5= ", 10-5)
# print("10*5= ", 10*5)
# print("10/5= ", 10/5)
# print("10//5= ", 10//5)
# print("10**5= ", 10**5)
# print("10%5= ", 10%5)

# assignment operator
# [==, +=, -=, *=, /=]
# x=5
# x+=10
# print("x is ",x)
#
# y=15
# y-=10
# print("y is ",y)
#
# z=10
# z*= 5
# print("z is ",z )
#
# w=10
# w/=2
# print("w is= ",w)

# comparision operator
# [==, !=, >=, <=, <, >]
# k = 8 #assining the value in k
# print(k==5) # comparing the value with k
# print(k==8)
# print(k<8)
# print(k>8)
# print(k<=8)
# print(k>=8)

# logical operator
# [and , or]
# truth table for AND and OR
#     AND             OR
# T   T   T       T   T   T
# T   F   F       T   F   T
# F   F   F       F   F   F

# a=True
# b=False
# print(a and b) #in this case both A and B are not equal but a/c to AND rule both  must be same to get the true value
# print(a or b)


# identity operator
# [is, is not]
# a=10
# b=15
# print(a is b) # here it will check that is a equal to b, if false then false or true then true
# print(a is not b) # here it will check that is a is not equal to true and yes then true and if it is equal then false

# membership operator
# [in, not in]
# list1=[10,15,332,456,4646,4,60,46,46]
# print(10 not in list1) #becuase 10 is already present in the list and it is checking that 10 isn't in list
# print(10 in list1)

# bitwise operator
# [AND, OR, NOT, XOR, 0-LEFT SHIFT, 0-RIGHT SHIFT
#0=00
#1=01
#2=10
#3=11
# binary range is 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512
# a=80 #--> binary of 80 is 0000101
# b=90 #--> binary of 90 is 0101101
# c=a & b #--> here we are  applying AND operator between these two binary then the result be 0000101 which is 80
# print("the value of c is- ",c)
# c=a | b #--> here we are applying OR operator between these two binary then the result be 0101101 which is 90
# print("the value of c is- ",c)

#---> 0&1 means 0
# --> 1&1/ 0&0 is true so 1 and 0 respectively
#--> in case of or opeartor if any one case has 1 and it is true, 0|1 is 1, 0|0 is 0
